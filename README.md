# Bookex - Exchanging printed words

## Description
This is a web application for a service of selling, interchanging or gifting books between the users of the app.
This app uses:
* React.
* Meteor.
* Node.
* MongoDB.

## Motivation
This is a project for a web development class in [Uniandes](https://www.uniandes.edu.co). The objective is to make a quick project using node, MongoDB, Meteor and ReactJS.

## Getting Started
if you want to run this project locally you are going to need ```npm``` and ```Meteor```. If you want to see a live demo of the project already deployed go [here.](https://book-ex.herokuapp.com/)

## Deployment
If you are going to deploy locally and not check the [demo](https://book-ex2.herokuapp.com/) then the first step is to download this repository on your system. Once you are done with that then:

### NPM
The next step is to install all the npm packages for the projects. If you have ```Meteor``` installed then open your terminal, get inside the repo where you have the repo downloaded and run:
* ```meteor npm install```
* or: ```npm install```

### Meteor
After all the npm packages are downloaded you are going to need to run it. For that you will need `Meteor` again, you don't need to enter any folder, just run `meteor` on the terminal and wait until it says `started your app` on the terminal.

### Seeing it Live
Now you only need to open your browser and write ```localhost:3000``` on the address bar and send it to see the live version of the project running locally.

## Tests
In order to use the test for this app you need to have followed the steps mentioned before at Deployment. Then in other terminal in the project's root directory run:
* ```meteor test --driver-package=cultofcoders:mocha --port 3100 ```
