# San Francisco distance between busses
## Description
This project is a web based visualization of the distance between buses on all the bus routes from San Francisco. To made this small project it was necessary to use this tools:
* [NextBus API :](https://gist.github.com/grantland/7cf4097dd9cdf0dfed14) to get the real time data from the buses.
* [Meteor.js:](https://www.meteor.com/) to work as a backend and create the server of the application.
