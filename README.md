# San Francisco distance between busses
## Description
This project is a web based visualization of the distance between buses on all the bus routes from San Francisco. To made this small project it was necessary to use this tools:
* [NextBus API :](https://gist.github.com/grantland/7cf4097dd9cdf0dfed14) To get the real time data from the buses.
* [Meteor.js:](https://www.meteor.com/) To work as a backend and create the server of the application.
* [React.js:](https://www.reactjs.org) To make the user interface.
* [D3.js:](https://d3js.org) To Make the visualization from the [NextBus](https://gist.github.com/grantland/7cf4097dd9cdf0dfed14) data.

## Motivation
Based on [John Guerra's](https://twitter.com/duto_guerra?) stack [visualization](https://beta.observablehq.com/@john-guerra/d3-stack-with-d3-nest) of the distance between two buses from the same route in San Francisco. The final exam of [webdevelopment class](https://twitter.com/duto_guerra?) on the university of [_Los Andes_](https://beta.observablehq.com/@john-guerra/d3-stack-with-d3-nest) was conceived.

The idea of the exam is to implement the visualization mentioned before on a website using the tools learned from the semester. There are some requirements like fetching the data the applications needs from [NextBus](https://gist.github.com/grantland/7cf4097dd9cdf0dfed14) every 10 seconds, adding the option to make comments and allow user to login and create accounts, and also [deploy on heroku](https://buses-distance.herokuapp.com/).

There are some changes from the original code of the visualization made by John. One of wich is a small fix to make the visualization more [useful and organized]()
